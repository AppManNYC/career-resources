## The Job Search
[Apply everywhere challange](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1clku6Fm_tpfGaYIZSGCtM4Zdo_NEkCuSb6E_p1NOUKU/edit) A list of internships/full time jobs that you can apply to
[The 2018 Wealthfront career launching companies list](https://blog.wealthfront.com/2018-wealthfront-career-launching-companies-list/) A list of US based private mid-sized companies that have a revenue run rate of between $20M and $300M, be on a trajectory to grow at a rate in excess of 50% for at least the next three or four years and have compelling unit economics.


### Career Fair Events
[Greylock Techfair](https://www.greylock.com/greylock-u/techfair/) Greylock is a very successful VC firm (they invested in Facebook, Airbnb, Linkedin). They organize a career fair every summer in SF and you need to apply and get accepted to be there. Companies like Airbnb, Pinterest, Quora, etc. will come. They share your resumes with the companies before the event so you don't have to bring a resume, but I still strongly recommend you show up in person.

[Start @ a Startup](http://startup.businesstoday.org/) This is held by Sequoia, another very successful VC firm (they invested in Airbnb, PayPal, Github, YouTube). You also need to apply and get accepted for this one. It is a 2-day event in NY during October, and companies that come are usually in an earlier stage than those in the Greylock event. Lots of onsite interviews happen there.

[Grace Hopper Conference](http://ghc.anitaborg.org/) This happens later than the last two, but if your school doesn't sponsor you to go then you need to buy the ticket somewhere in July and it's non-refundable. The tickets are sold out super fast. A list of GHC scholarships and their deadlines: https://github.com/freialobo/GHC-Scholarships

[Intern Supply](http://www.intern.supply/) A ton of software/design intern application portals in one place.

[JPMorgan Chase's Code for Good](http://careers.jpmorgan.com/careers/programs/code-for-good) A two-day hackathon organized by Chase. If you go you might get a job offer from them without interview.

### Fellowships
This basically means you apply, and if you get accepted you'll get to work at cool startups/companies, get mentorship, go to some networking events, etc.

- [KPCB Fellows](http://kpcbfellows.com/)  They have 3 types of internships: Design, Engineering and Product. Each has a different deadline. For this one you just apply online.
- [HackNY Fellowship Program](https://apply.hackny.org/)
- [True Entrepreneur Corps (TEC) summer fellowship](https://trueventures.com/tec/)
- [PennApps Fellows](http://www.pennappsfellows.com/) 10 week summer internship in Philly, with free housing, fellows events, etc.
