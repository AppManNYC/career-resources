Some SWE/PM/Designer related career resources for students

## Career Fair Events
[Greylock Techfair](https://www.greylock.com/greylock-u/techfair/) Airbnb, Pinterest, Quora, etc. Greylock is a very successful VC firm (they invested in Facebook, Airbnb, Linkedin). They organize a career fair every summer in SF and you need to apply and get accepted to be there. Companies like Airbnb, Pinterest, Quora, etc. will come. They share your resumes with the companies before the event so you don't have to bring a resume, but I still strongly recommend you show up in person.

[Start @ a Startup](http://startup.businesstoday.org/) This is held by Sequoia, another very successful VC firm (they invested in Airbnb, PayPal, Github, YouTube). You also need to apply and get accepted for this one. It is a 2-day event in NY during October, and companies that come are usually in an earlier stage than those in the Greylock event. Lots of onsite interviews happen there, and some companies would treat you dinner at very nice restaurants.

[Grace Hopper Conference](http://ghc.anitaborg.org/) This happens later than the last two, but if your school doesn't sponsor you to go then you need to buy the ticket somewhere in July and it's non-refundable. The tickets are sold out super fast. A list of GHC scholarships and their deadlines: https://github.com/freialobo/GHC-Scholarships

There's another one that's for internships only:
KPCB Fellows: http://kpcbfellows.com/  They have 3 types of internships: Design, Engineering and Product. Each has a different deadline. For this one you just apply online.

Not really career related but: Code Jam to IO for Women https://sites.google.com/site/codejamtoioforwomen/ basically you solve algo problems online and the top 125 or something gets a free ticket to Google I/O. The problems are a lot easier than the real Code Jam.
